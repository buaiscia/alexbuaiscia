#INFORMATION

Personal website with portfolio.

Constantly updated, the website is a partial show of my work with vanilla JS. It uses the EJS engine to integrate JS in HTML and it includes both frontend and backend. 

The site is static, however, it is built with a backbone of NodeJS (with Express) for routing, auth, connection to DB, modelling, security; in the blog section the data is stored on mongoDB (which manages both users and authentication, among others). 

#INSTRUCTIONS
